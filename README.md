# A PHP MVC project using medoo database

## Description

This demo is based on Colt Steele's 'Farm Stand' project in his course 'The Web Developer Bootcamp'.
I have refactored it using PHP and the [Medoo](https://medoo.in/) database framework.

## Installation
- Install dependecies:

  ```bash
  $ composer install
  ```
- Prepare a database. 
- Change the database and mailtrap credentials in the file app/config/config.php.
